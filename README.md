# LSTM and BART: comparison in title generation from abstracts in papers

This is a comparative paper between Long Short-Term Memory Network [LSTM] and Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer [BART]. It aims to verify the cost/benefit of one over the other under certain circunstances. Although BART is a more consistent model and yields better results in text summarization, LSTM is not far behind. This work seek to demostrate that in small text bodies, LSTM can achieve results comparable to those of BART, being a lighter and less expensive model.
